# **Sales Forecasting: Fighting Data Leakage**

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates the challenges of data leakage in machine learning, using a sales forecasting dataset. Data leakage can lead to overly optimistic model performance, making it appear as though the model predicts with near-perfect accuracy, while in reality, it utilizes information unavailable during actual predictions.

Through this project, I highlight:
- How data leakage can significantly skew model results.
- Methods to detect and mitigate leakage.
- The importance of critical thinking when interpreting model performance.

## **Key Takeaways**
1. **Data Leakage Identified**:  
   During the development process, I raised concerns about potential data leakage in the dataset. Upon investigation, it became evident that the dataset contained information unavailable at prediction time, leading to artificially inflated performance metrics.

2. **Dataset Revision**:  
   After reporting this issue, the dataset was revised to remove the leakage. As a result:
   - The previous results achieved with this notebook cannot be replicated with the updated dataset.
   - This notebook serves as an educational example of how leakage can occur and why addressing it is critical.

3. **Awareness is Key**:  
   This project underscores the necessity of carefully analyzing datasets to avoid falling into the trap of believing predictions with unrealistic accuracy (e.g., ~100%). Awareness of leakage ensures more robust and generalizable models.

## **Project Features**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Insights into sales trends and patterns.
  - Initial preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data.
  
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Experimented with 10 different algorithms, including regression and ensemble techniques.
  - Compared model performance metrics before and after addressing leakage.

- **Anti-Leakage Practices**:
  - Demonstrates the use of strict validation strategies.
  - Highlights the pitfalls of including future information in training datasets.

## **Usage**
This notebook is shared to:
1. Educate practitioners about the dangers of data leakage.
2. Showcase techniques for identifying and addressing leakage.
3. Provide a framework for building reliable and realistic forecasting models.

> **Note**: The results from this notebook cannot be replicated with the updated dataset due to the removal of leaked information.

## **Acknowledgments**
I would like to thank the dataset providers for promptly addressing the leakage issue after it was reported. This proactive step ensures more reliable research and analysis for the community.

## **Lessons Learned**
- Always critically evaluate datasets for potential issues.
- Validate models rigorously using proper cross-validation techniques.
- Avoid relying solely on high performance metrics; question their validity and context.
